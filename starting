Starting...

October 10, 2018

Every time we start could be difficult and stressful but at same time could be interesting and joyful because it is the process to discover new things.

We can develop new skills and use tools to guide us during our new adventures.

Keep in mind to develop self-control in three aspects: effort, concentration and intensity.

At same time remember the seven things you can control in life:

  Your Breath
  Your Self-Talk
  Your Gratitude
  Your Body Language – “power posing”
  Your Mental and Physical Fitness
  Your Diet
  Your Sleep
